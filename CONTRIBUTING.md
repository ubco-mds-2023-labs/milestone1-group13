### Workflow Practices

Continuous integration: TBD\
Workflow: Branching workflow\
Group size: 3

All group members utilized a simple branching model that revolved around a single main branch. This helped facilitate collaboration, code review, and continuous integration when developing the Spotify Dashboard. Each group member was responsible for carrying out the tasks of developing specific visualizations in dash that helped contribute to an overall visualization dashboard in Python code using Spotify dataset(s).

Nijiati Abulizi: track and genre information visualization(s), Proposal.md

Kulaphong Jitareerat: audio features visualization(s), README.md

Craig Adlam: popularity metrics visualization(s), CONTRIBUTING.md

All group members should be able to collaborate throughout the development stages by meeting in person as well as interacting online. Each member contributed to designing layout and supportive documentation.
