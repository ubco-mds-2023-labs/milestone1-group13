# Code of Conduct 

## Introduction  

During the development of the `YelpViz` R package on GitHub, our goal is to simplify the visualization process by retrieving business-related information using Yelp's API and providing plotted charts for analysis. However, we would also like to ensure that the collaboration process is an open, friendly, and supportive environment for all members to enjoy.
